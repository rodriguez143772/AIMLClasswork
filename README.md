Collection of Classworks/Projects I worked on during the Fall 2024 Semester of my Intro to AI / Machine Learning Class.

Used primarily Python as the language for handling data and data sets. 
Utilized libraries such as matplotlib, Pandas, SciKit learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn, and PyTorch for the models.
